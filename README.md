## Where am I?

Here you find a bunch of general directives on how to design and implement software in typescript (or javascript) with a strong focus on efficiency, readability maintainability.

This includes directives on: 

- [code style](./styling) primarly for readability, but also for maintainability.
- [js runtime optimizations](./optimizations), including (ofthen hidden) memory allocations and cpu usage. 
- [typing and assertions](./typing) mainly for maintainability and robustness.

And it also includes some [real world examples](./examples/) showing how these guidelines were applied.
